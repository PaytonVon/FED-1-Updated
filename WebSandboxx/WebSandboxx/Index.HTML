                <h2>Front End Development</h2>
                <p>
                    Front End Development is the tier of Fullstack Web Development that deals with the visual elements
                    of an application that the user interacts with. The main three languages used in Front End Development is
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the three languages that web browsers understand.
                    <br /> <!-- This is a line break. It is a self-closing tag and does not require any attributes.-->
                    If you were to compare this tier of development to a part of the human body, it would be like the skin.

                    <p>
                        Hypertext Markup language (HTML) is used to define the structure of the content of a web page.
                        It is arguably the most important front end devlopment language because the other languages
                        use HTML elements to preform their respective functions.

                    <p>
                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used for the formatting and layout of a web page content. It was
                        introduced as a way to separate the concerns of markup (HTML) and formatting (CSS) into seperate files.

                    <p>
                        JavaScript (JS) allows us to make our web pages more interactive. Its primary use is that it provides
                        the ability to preform programming logic in the front end, react to events, and validate form data.
